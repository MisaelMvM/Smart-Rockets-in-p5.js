- In this (very long) Coding Challenge, I implement a genetic algorithm from scratch and create "smart rockets" (based on a simulation by Jer Thorp). The rockets evolve the "best" path to a target, moving around obstacles.
- I've followed this tutorial making some modifications but always trying to achieve a good result! I've had so much fun and I've learned so much !
